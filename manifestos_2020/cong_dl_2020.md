# 1. LOKPAL & BHAGIDARI
AAP was formed on the basis of the demand for a Lokpal. They quit the government they formed in 2014 after just 49 days over the passing of the Jan Lokpal Bill. Yet, they still did not fulfilltheir main poll promise. AAP put forward a diluted Jan Lokpal Bill, which was far weaker than the Lokpal Bill passed by INC-led UPA government. They now use the excuse that the LG has not assented to their Bill, even though they have managed to get 30 Bills of their choice turned into Acts, showing a clear lack of political will and intend.

## 1.1
Unlike AAP, the INC will pass a Lokpal Bill within the first six months, on the lines of the much stronger Lokpal Bill passed by the INC-led UPA Government.

## 1.2
The Lokpal will have powers to initiate action on complaints including those against the Chief Minister, all other ministers, and the bureaucracy at all levels.

## 1.3
All MLAs will declare their immoveable properties on 1st January every year. Fifty of sixty-six AAP MLAs have refused to declare their assets and liabilities as directed by Delhi Lokayukta.

## 1.4
INC shall revamp the e-governance structure of GNCDT. Websites and portals are old and they hide more than they show. We shall follow a system of 'OPEN GOVERNANCE' with best global practices on data sharing.

## 1.5
INCshall renew its highly successful 'Bhagidari' scheme and revive the spirit of people's participation in governance. We shall engage with civil society, citizen groups, RWAs, and NGOs at all levels for all major decisions. Public consultations will be the foundation of our decision making and implementation of our schemes.

# 2. JOBS CREATION
Both BJP & AAP have failed to create jobs. Government of India itself has conceded that the National unemployment is at a 45-year high. CMIE data shows that the national average rate of unemployment in last 4 months is 7.53% and for Delhi, it is double the national average at 15.03%

## 2.1 Supporting Jobs Creation

### 2.1.1
INC shall launch a 'Yuva Swabhiman Yojana', an Unemployment Allowance for those youth registered in Employment Exchanges in Delhi. For graduate youth, ₹5,000 per month will be given, and for postgraduate youth, ₹7,500 per month will be given.

### 2.1.2
INC will establish a network of 'Skill Training and Internship Programmes' in cooperation with the private sector to train, skill and reskill unemployed youth. Unemployment allowance will only be paid to those individuals who opt for a skills training programme for at least 100 days.

### 2.1.3
INC shall hold periodic placement camps in partnership with the private sector to provide employment opportunities to the individuals imparted with skill training.

### 2.1.4
Due to the high prices of industrial/commercial electricity, industries and commercial establishments are moving out of Delhi, thereby resulting in massive unemployment. INC shall provide industrial power at a tariff rate of ₹6/unit, as done by the INC Government in Punjab, and this will be inclusive of all municipal taxes and surcharges, to get non-polluting industries back in Delhi.

### 2.1.5
INC shall charge domestic power tariff rates to those professional activities (such as lawyers, chartered accountants, media professionals, architects etc..) as defined in Chapter 15 of the Delhi Master Plan in relation to "mixed-land use", that are permitted in residential areas.

### 2.1.6
INC shall fill all vacant posts in Delhi Government in the first 6 months of its government. We will regularise all ad-hoc appointments in Delhi government. We will also ensure that all those selected through competitive exams conducted by the Delhi Government, shall be absorbed immediately.

### 2.1.7
INC shall enact a legislation within 3 months of coming to power for contractual employees in both the public and private sector wherein necessary provisions will be made to ensure that there is no exploitation, minimum wages are paid equivalent to regular employees using the principle of equal pay for equal work and whoever has worked for 500 days with or without breaks, will be regularized as a permanent employee within that organisation. This will include ad-hoc employees in municipal corporations, Delhi Transport Corporation, schools, and hospitals.

## 2.2 Support to startups

### 2.2.1
INC shall launch the "Yaari Startup Incubation Fund", a₹ 5000 Cr corpus to incentivize young entrepreneurs to open Startups. The Central Government has a 10,000 Cr Startup Fund, but INC in Delhi alone will invest 1000 Cr per year for 5 years.

### 2.2.2
INC shall provide individuals belonging to BPL families a one-time grant upto 25 lakh for establishing a start-up.

### 2.2.3
INC shall start the Rajiv Gandhi Internship Programme, under which commercial and industrial establishments employing 20 persons or more, and, any company doing professional work with an experience of 10 years or more in Delhi, will be encouraged to start an internship programme for youth upto the age of 30. This programme will cover 10% of total strength of the organization and will aim to impart skills to trainees, followed by merit-based employment from among the trained apprentices whenever a job is created or becomes vacant in that business. We will pay a monthly stipend for one year to the trainees under this programme. (Professional work will be based on categories as defined in Chapter 15.8 of the Delhi Master Plan, such as Lawyers and Chartered Accountants.)

### 2.2.4
INC shall provide fiscal (tax) incentives to businesses that employ a minimum of 33% of women.

### 2.2.5
INC shall ensure that any proprietorship firm with a woman proprietor as its head will be eligible for fiscal incentives.

## 2.3 Retrenchment Benefits

### 2.3.1
INC believes those who have lost their jobs, must be helped on a priority basis so they can get back quickly on their feet by providing them with re-training in skills demanded by the market, and assistance for job placement. INC shall provide retrenchment benefits upto ₹5,000 to those who have lost their jobs. INC shall also initiate re-skill redevelopment programmes for mid-career training.

## 2.4 Economic Empowerment & Financial Assistance Programmes

### 2.4.1
INC shall reserve 33% posts for women in government jobs.

### 2.4.2
INC shall fill the backlog of vacancies in posts reserved for Scs, STs and OBCs.

### 2.4.3
INC shall start an Interim (Short Term) Financial Assistance Programme for individuals or families who need short term financial help to tide them over a difficult period such as sudden illness, accident, loss of earning member of family, etc. The eligibility and amount of assistance will depend on individual or family circumstances and on economic factors of the needy residents. Eligibility criteria will be strictly vetted to prevent leakages.


# 3. WOMEN SAFETY & EMPOWERMENT
Historically, INC has been at the forefront of the struggle for women's rights, equality and empowerment. India's only woman Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, belonged to the INC. Smt. Sheila Dikshit, an INC woman, governed Delhi for 15 years and is loved and admired by all. Almost all the woman centric laws in the country are passed by INC. We mainstreamed gender in government schemes.

## 3.1 Women Empowerment

### 3.1.1
INC will implement 33% reservation for women in jobs in government sector and endeavors to achieve the same in educational institutions and the private sector through incentives.

### 3.1.2
Delhi was amongst the first few states to enact a law for 50% reservation of women in municipal corporations. INC shall pass a resolution that as a first step, 33% reservation be implemented for Parliament and assemblies.

### 3.1.3
INC will provide free girl education in government schools and colleges, from Nursery to PhD. This will be done under the Ladli Scheme, a flagship programme for the empowerment of women and the girl child. It was praised throughout the country and got global acclaim, but has been weakened and not been given the importance it merits. INC will ensure that the Ladli Scheme attains the same glory and importance as during the INC regime.



### 3.1.4
INC will provide free health check-ups to all women once a year.

### 3.1.5
INC will provide a 'Shagan' of ₹1,10,000 for marriage of graduate girls from EWS households, to encourage girls to complete graduation.

### 3.1.9
INC will provide compulsory training in self-defense to the girls at the secondary school level.

### 3.1.10
INC will provide special training and recruitment of women drivers and conductors for DTC buses. On similar lines, INC will provide training and facilitate issuance of badges for women autorickshaw and taxi drivers.

### 3.1.11
INC will provide more night shelters for women will be built with adequate facilities and security.

### 3.1.12
INC will provide adequate number of safe and hygienic public toilets for women across the city.

### 3.1.13
INC will install sanitary napkin vending machines in public spaces, schools and colleges.

### 3.1.14
INC will invest in public awareness campaigns regarding existing legislations to protect women from domestic violence and other security issues.

## 3.2 Women Security

### 3.2.1
Women security is not just a law and order problem. It has a social dimension to it. Understanding this fact, the INC Government started a number of initiatives for the protection of women. INC launched the 'Awaaz Uthao Programme' for safety audits and community involvement in the safety of women, and INC's Education Department prepared a mandatory, detailed, gender sensitization course in schools. 181, a women's helpline, was launched by INC Government and was directly monitored by the Chief Minister and her office. 181 has been totally diluted and made toothless by AAP, and has been transferred from the Chief Minister's office to the Mahila Aayog. Mahila Aayog further diluted it by handing it over to a private entity.

### 3.2.2
INC Government will revive the 181 women's helpline by bringing it back under the Chief Minister's office. Gender sensitization course will become an important part of school curriculum. Avaaz Uthao Programme will be restored and linked to 181, and brought back under the ambit of the Chief Minister's Office..

### 3.2.3
As per records furnished by the Central Government in Parliament on 29 November 2019, Delhi has only been able to spend 5% of the Nirbhaya Fund set up by the UPA government. INC will ensure that the entire fund is properly utilized for these above mentioned purposes.

### 3.2.4
INC will ensure the strict implementation of Vishakha guidelines by companies registered and operating in Delhi.

### 3.2.5
AAP Manifesto promised to "operationalize 47 new Courts" in Delhi by 2020. The Central Government calculated the requirement as 63 Fast Track Courts. Unfortunately, only 10 are functional as on 30 September 2019. INC will work together with the Central Government to ensure that the 63 Fast Track Courts required for Delhi become functional within this year, for speedy disposal of justice. More POCSO courts will also be added.

### 3.2.6
Street lighting is an essential means to secure the city. INC will ensure that all the dark spots in Delhi are identified and lit.

## 3.3 Financial Empowerment of Women

### 3.3.1
Gender Resource Centres for the economic empowerment of women were set up during the INC to provide single window services for all Delhi government schemes. These have been discontinued by the AAP government. INC will restore the Gender Resource Centres.

### 3.3.2
Maternity leave with pay entitlements will be ensured to all sectors including domestic workers. The INC Government will create a corpus under the Labour Department to provide 50% of such cost to an employee working in private sector, limited to ₹15,000 per month.

# 4. URBAN POOR

## 4.1
Rahulji Ki Pukaar, Berozgari Pe Vaar, Rupay 72 Hazaar. 5 Lakh needy families to get 72,000 per year.

## 4.2
INC will set up a separate Department of Urban Poverty Alleviation. Further, taking into consideration the condition of urban women in the unorganized sector, a separate cell will be created to look after women in the unorganized sector.

## 4.3
INC shall endeavor that every household in Delhi gets clean drinking water so that it is not dependent on water tanks or packaged drinking water. The Delhi Jal Board pumps in treated water at the rate of 216.48 Ipcd (litres per capita per day). Singapore, with 143 Ipcd and Hong Kong with 203Ipcd, provide 24-hour water supply. The biggest problem for Delhi is not availability of water, but management of the available water,. 55% of water treated and pumped by Jal Board seeps into the ground due to faulty water supply network as well as pilferage by the water tanker mafia. The INC will ensure that all such seepages, leakages, and pilferages by the water tank mafia will be plugged and stopped so that Delhi gets 24-hour water supply.

## 4.4
The high cost of electricity has forced industries out of Delhi in the past five years, leading to job losses for Delhi's residents. The number of factories in Delhi has fallen 12.40%, from 2013-14 to 2017-18 according to the Annual Survey of Industries carried out by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The number of workers employed has declined 9% from 75,273 in 2013-14 to 68,630 in 2017-18, making an already bad unemployment situation worse. Delhi's unemployment rate is double than the national avg. One of the main reasons for this is high rates of electricity for industrial and non-domestic sector, which is the highest in the country. Due to the high prices of industrial/commercial electricity, industries and commercial establishments are moving out of Delhi, thereby resulting in massive unemployment. INC will provide industrial power at a tariff rate of 6/unit as done by INC Government in Punjab, and this will be inclusive of all municipal taxes and surcharges, to get non-polluting industries back in Delhi.

## 4.5
The INC-led UPA government had enacted Street Vendors Protection of Livelihood Act in 2013. Under this Act, vending spaces, number equaling 2.5% of the population, were to be identified, created and distributed among the street vendors. Unfortunately, out of 5 lakh vending spaces to be created, not even one has been created or allotted in the last 5 years. Under Sec. 3 of this Act, until these 5 lakh spaces were identified and allotted, no street vendor could have been uprooted from his/her vending space. Unfortunately, in the last 5 years, thousands of vendors have been uprooted from their vending spaces. The state government has failed to protect their right to livelihood under the Act. Even though elections for Town Vending Committees, as provided under this Act, have taken place, these Committees are non-functional because of official apathy. The INC will ensure that 5 lakh vending spaces as provided under the Act shall be identified, created and allotted to the street vendors at the earliest, and no street vendor shall be uprooted before this exercise is conducted, as per the provisions of the Act.



## 4.6
INC shall conduct a state-wide survey of unorganized workers, including rag pickers, construction workers, domestic workers, rickshaw drivers etc. INC will ensure an easy registration process of all unorganized workers and issue ID cards so that they get the benefit of government schemes.

### 4.6.1
INC will initiate a scheme in which any needy person, without means for conducting the last rites of any family member, can approach an elected representative, and on his/her recommendation and a proforma, the cremation/ burial ground will provide free facility which shall be reimbursed by the government.

## 4.7
INC shall hold periodic placement camps in partnership with the private sector to provide employment opportunities to the individuals imparted with skill training.

## 4.8
INC will provide a 'Shagan' of ₹ 1,10,000 for marriage of graduate girls from EWS households, to encourage girls to complete graduation.

## 4.9
INC will provide subsidised education for all students living in Notified Slums and all Resettlement Colonies until Class 12, in both public and private schools.

## 4.10
INC will establish 'Ambedkar Skill Development Hubs' in every district to promote education amongst students from backward classes.

## 4.11
झुग्गी वाले - अब पक्के दिल्ली वाले' (Jhuggi Dwellers are now permanent residents).INC will ensure each family living in JJ clusters, including tenants and owners, gets a flat of 350sq feetat the same place of their slums through in-situ rehabilitation, on the lines of the INC initiated projects in Kathputli Colony, Kalkaji, Jailerwala Bagh etc.

### 4.11.1
INC will establish 'Labour Addas' near existing chowks and patli mazdoors. and develop such spaces with basic facilities like shed, drinking water, seating, and toilets. These will also include 'Labour Registration Centres' for providing labourers assistance in social security schemes. Provision for new and existing labour addas will be made in the upcoming master plan. These spaces will also act as linkages with skill development centres.

## 4.12
INC will regularize ALL Unauthorized Colonies, and will spend ₹35,0000 Cr in five years for the much-needed upliftment of these colonies.

## 4.13
For the first time, starvation deaths took place in the national capital of the country, in the Deputy Chief Minister's constituency. INC will ensure that no eligible person is left out from PDS Security Net (ration card). We will also set up Ration Card camps once in 6 months, to ensure that no eligible person has to struggle for food.

### 4.13.1
Entirely managed and run by women staff, INC shall open 100 such Indira Canteens in Delhi on the lines of ones started in Karnataka by the INC. They will offer fresh and nutritious meals at subsidized rate of ₹15.

## 4.14
With the advent of taxi services like Ola, Uber etc. legally plying three-wheelers and e-rickshaw owners are facing difficulty repaying loans. To address this difficulty, the INC, as a one-time gesture, will grant subsidy to the owners of such vehicles, so that they can pay installments of pending loans.


# 5. WELFARE OF SCHEDULED CASTE, SCHEDULED TRIBES & OBCS
The Constitution of India provides for reservation in employment and educational institutions for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. We must do even more to ensure justice to the historically disadvantaged sections of our society.

## 5.1
INC will enact a law to require the state government to transparently disclose, in their budget documents, the allocations to SCs and STs under the Special Component Plan for SCs and Tribal Sub-Plan for STs and to prohibit diversion of such funds.

## 5.2
INC will ensure that special courts to try offences under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 are appropriately established, as per provisions of the law.

## 5.3
INC will set up an SC/ST/OBC Development Board.

## 5.4
INC will provide free legalAid to all SCs, STs, and OBCs who seek to achieve their rights or intend to get wrongs done against them redressed through the judicial process. We will also create a separate legal cell in the Law Department for this purpose.

## 5.5
INC will provide loans up to 5 lakh, without surety, for SC/ST/OBC persons.

## 5.6
INC shall fill all backlog of vacancies of SCs, STs and OBCs in the Delhi Government within a year.

## 5.7
INC shall establish 'Ambedkar Pratibha Vidyalayas' (Skill Development Hubs) in each district.

## 5.8
INC will establish 'Sant Ravidas Hostels' for college students belonging to SCs, STs, and OBCs.

Under the Affirmative Action Programme, INC will ensure that a fair share of government procurement and government contracts are given to SCs, STs, and OBCs.

## 5.10
INC will provide financial assistance to students belonging to SC/ST/OBC categories, to pursue higher education outside Delhi if they fail to get admission for the same in Delhi.

## 5.11
INC will provide coaching fees for students belonging to EWS families in reputed and identified tuition centres for Competitive Exams.

## 5.12
Safai Karamcharis face acute professional hazards by being exposed to dust, garbage and hazardous waste. INC will ensure they are provided with adequate safety gear, including proper gloves, masks etc.Agencies and concerned officers will be held liable for punishment who engage in or perpetuate manual cleaning of sewers.



## 5.13
For the last 5 years, Delhi has seen Safai Karamcharis going on strike and protests on roads for the non-payment of salaries, arrears and retirement benefits for months. These protests adversely affected the cleanliness of the city and increased health hazards. The MCD and Delhi Government only engaged in blame games and did nothing important for this segment, who should be called Paryavaran Rakshaks. We should give them due respect and ensure they are properly taken care of by the government. INC will name Safai Karamcharis as Paryavaran Rakshaks. We will implement the 5th Delhi Finance Commission Report without withholding the amount due to the municipal corporations. During the INC regime, whenever municipal corporations faced constraints in paying salaries to their employees, the Delhi INC always came to the rescue of the municipal corporations, and we will continue to support them.

## 5.14
All temporary, ad-hoc, and contractual Safai Karamcharis will be regularised.

## 5.15
INC will ensure basic facilities for Safai Karamcharis, like shed, drinking water etc.

## 5.16
INC will ensure that the number of Safai Karamcharis will be commensurate with the increasing population. It has not been increased in the last 40 years. Yardsticks for the number of Safai Karamcharis will be changed accordingly.

# 6. MINORITY WELFARE

## 6.1
INC will offer special 'Skill Development scholarships' to religious as well as linguistic minorities of Delhi.

## 6.2
INC will ensure that all vacancies of language teachers (Urdu, Gurmukhi, Bhojpuri and such) will be filled within 100 days, to encourage linguistic minorities.

## 6.3
INC will provide interest free loans, along with scholarships if required, to students with extraordinary ability selected for education courses abroad, to enable them to pursue their studies.

## 6.4
INC shall ensure that long pending matters in the judicial system will be reviewed and that justice will be delivered expeditiously.

## 6.5
INC will provide free legal aid to minorities who face any discrimination on religious grounds.

## 6.6
INC will provide substantial funding for the promotion of their language, culture, and art.

# 7. EDUCATION
Education is a merit good and must be available to all children as a public good. Unfortunately, in the last 5 years the AAP government has failed miserably in this sector. It failed to spend full budgetary allocation and the government education system deteriorated to the extent that lakhs of students from government schools shifted to private schools. The biggest proof of Delhi Government's monumental failure in Education is 12th Standard Board Results. At the beginning of third term of the INC Government, 75,970 students passed 12th Standard Board Exams from Government Schools in 2009. It rose year after year and almost doubled to 1.47 lakh students in 2014. Since then, under the AAP regime, it progressively fell down continuously, year after year, for the first time in history to 1.02 lakh in 2018. A drop of 44%!

## 7.1 Right to Quality Education

### 7.1.1
It is because of Smt. Sonia Gandhi's vision that the nation enacted the historic Right to Education Act, which also provides 25% reservation for EWS students in private schools. It is the INC party that doubled the enrolment of students in Delhi Government's schools. Delhi Government under INC rule had shown best results in India. This will be implemented with more vigour. We will implement "Right to Quality Education” to ensure that school children in Delhi are imparted quality education, at par with the best global practices.

### 7.1.2
INC will provide subsidised Education for all students living in Notified Slums and all Resettlement Colonies until Class 12, in both public and private schools.

### 7.1.3
INC will provide free girl education in government schools and colleges, from Nursery to PhD. This will be done under the Ladli Scheme, an initiative of the INC.

### 7.1.4
INC Party will ensure full spending of Budgetary Allocation in Education Sector without a single paisa getting lapsed or diverted into other heads. The barometer of efficiency of government performance is finding the percentage of the amount spent fromCapital account of any sector. Under AAP, 46% of Budget allocated in under Capital (previously Plan) expenditure of the Department of Education in 5 years, remained unspent and thus got lapsed or diverted to other heads by AAP Government due to its inefficiency. On the other hand, INC from 2006-07 to 2013-14, not only spent all of the budgetary allocations for the Department of Education, but in fact, spent 3% more than was allocated in the budgets.



### 7.1.5
INC will make sure that enrolment in Delhi Government & Government-aided schools increases. Delhi experiences a population growth of 2% per year. Till 2013-14 the total number of students in governments schools used to increase every year due to INC policies like RTE. Unfortunately for the firsttime in history, instead of increasing, the number of students has decreased. Under the AAP government between 2013-14 to 2017-18, Delhi saw a reduction in total number of students enrolled in government schools by 1.32 lakh, which is a reduction of 8% of what the number of students was in 2013-14. Further, more than 20 lakh students are out of school. [Praja Report, March 2019]

### 7.1.6
AAP promised 500 new schools and 20 new degree colleges in their election manifesto, but delivered none. There has been more publicity by the AAP Government than actual improvement in school infrastructure and quality of education. INC promises to increase not just allocation, but also expenditure to provide basic and adequate infrastructure in every school from Class 1 to Class 12 that will include classrooms, libraries, laboratories, swimming pools, playgrounds, toilets, drinking water, etc.

### 7.1.7
INC will support the establishment of special schools for children with special needs.

### 7.1.8
INC will establish 'Ambedkar Skill Development Hubs' in every district to promote education amongst students from backward classes.

## 7.2 Welfare of Teachers

### 7.2.1
INC will ensure that teachers are trained and less burdened and are covered under a social security net.

### 7.2.2
There are around 11,000 vacancies of post graduate teachers (PGT) and trained graduate teachers (TGT) in Delhi's Government schools. Around 500 posts of principals are vacant. Hundreds of posts of language teachers are also vacant. INC pledges to fill in the entire backlog of teachers, including language teachers within 6 months.

### 7.2.3
INC will give one-time relaxation to guest teachers and regularise them as permanent teachers.

### 7.2.4
DUTA is on strike on the issue of one-time absorption of ad hoc and temporary teachers. INC will endeavour to have the demands of ad hoc teachers accepted. To begin with, all ad hoc and temporary teachers in colleges under Delhi Government management will be absorbed immediately as permanent.

### 7.2.5
INC pledges to ensure quality education in schools, and will ensure that Pupil Teacher Ratio of 25:1 is implemented.

### 7.2.6
INC will provide coaching fees for students belonging to EWS families in reputed and identified tuition centres for exams, including higher education.

### 7.2.7
INC will appoint two special educators in every school, for differently-abled children.

### 7.2.8
We will provide fellowships to teachers who pursue an online masters/certificate/professional course in order to enrich themselves professionally from reputed and identified institutions.

## 7.3 Mid-Day Meal Scheme

### 7.3.1
INC will improve the quality and delivery of the Mid-Day Meal Scheme and ensure a balanced and nutritious diet. We will ensure a social audit of the scheme.

### 7.3.2
We will provide banana and soya or boiled eggs as part of Mid-Day Meal scheme, in order to improve the protein intake of children

## 7.4 Higher Education

### 7.4.1
INC will focus on building at least 10 new world-class colleges, including an Arts University, a University of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a Skills University, a Sports University and a Languages University. Our record speaks for itself: INC opened 14 universities and deemed universities and 98 colleges in Delhi over 15 years while the Aam Aadmi Party has not opened even one university or college in the past six years.

### 7.4.2
INC will encourage research by setting up a Chief Minister's Corpus, under which we will set up a "Homi Bhabha Research Fund". In five years, the INC will allocate ₹1000 crores to this corpus.

### 7.4.3
Just as the INC ensured an annual intake of 33,000 students (with 85% reservation for Delhi residents) in the Guru Gobind IP university, we will increase access to higher education for Delhi's students by double this number in other state higher education institutes. We will also provide resources to universities to come up with new courses and facilitate linkages with companies and markets.

### 7.4.4
INC will expand the scope of Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojna. The scheme entails a subsidy to coaching centers preparing economically backward candidates for competitive exams. Currently the scheme is not working as money has only been spent on advertisements rather than being provided to actual beneficiaries. In the current scheme, AAP has not spent a single paisa on the scheme this year, although allocation is ₹40 Cr.

# 8 HEALTH CARE
Healthcare is a public good and the right of every citizen.  The AAP government has failed to spend 32.14% of the capital (planned) budget allocated to health until March 2019. The amount has either lapsed or been diverted. INC promises to spend 100% of budget allocations on health.



## 8.1
INC on average, built almost one new hospital per year, while AAP has opened zero in its entire term. Unfortunately, AAP has failed to add even a single hospital or bed to this number, and Arvind Kejriwal has been blaming poor migrants in Delhi. INC will make up for AAP's laxity and restore the pace of hospital construction to that of the INC by building ten super-specialty hospitals in Delhi in the next five years, and we will also add 5,000 new maternity beds.

## 8.2
INC will additionally establish 2 new medical colleges in rural Delhi, and will add 300 more medical seats in existing and new colleges.

## 8.3
AAP inherited 1,398 dispensaries from INC. We will take the total number to 3,000, including facilities for pathology and testing.

## 8.4
It has been widely reported in the past five years that machines, such as for MRI and CT scans, are often non-functional in government facilities. INC will implement policies to ensure 24-hour functional diagnostics machines. In addition, INC will add such facilities in all hospitals that lack these to reduce the waiting time for patients.

## 8.5
INC will provide for expenditure incurred on diagnostics in private facilities where such facilities are unavailable in government hospitals.

## 8.6
INC will providea "panic button" for the safety of differently-abled and senior citizens living alone, to ensure emergency help and ambulance services are accessible whenever required.

## 8.7
INC will regularize all adhoc or contractual health employees as permanent, if they have completed 500 days of service with or without a break.

# 13. ELECTRICITY & WATER SUPPLY

## 13.1 Financial Subsidy and Incentives:

### 13.1.1
Bijli Paani Bachao, Paise Kamao | पानी सबका अधिकार, भविष्य का रखना ख़्याल ! Paani Bachao, Paisa Kamao:INC will launch a flagship water tariff scheme where by a cashback will be provided to households conserving water. If any household has used less than the free 20,000 litres of water, then proportional cash back will be provided on the water bill. This will incentivise water conservation. We will give 30 paise per litre saved. So, if a family saves 10,000 litres of water, it will get 3,000. The money will be transferred directly into the bank accounts of the people

### 13.1.2
INC shall endeavour that every household in Delhi gets clean drinking water so that it is not dependent on Water Tanks or Packaged Drinking Water. The Delhi Jal Board pumps in treated water at the rate of 216.48 litres per capita per day. Singapore, with 143 litres and Hong Kong with 203 litres provide 24-hour water supply. The biggest problem for Delhi is not availability of water, but management of the available water. 55% of water managed by Jal Board seeps into the ground due to faulty water supply network as well as pilferage by the water tanker mafia. It will be the endeavour of the INC to ensure that all such seepages, leakages, and pilferages by the water tank mafia will be plugged/stopped so that Delhi get 24-hour water supply.



### 13.1.3
INC shall ensure 100% Water Treatment. As of now, 45% of Delhi's sewage is untreated. INC will ensure a two-pronged strategy - smaller sewage treatment mechanism will be installed at the source, and bigger sewer treatment plants will be installed closer to the river Yamuna so that all drains which pump polluted water into the river are treated, and this will lessen pollution in the river as well.

### 13.1.4
Bijli Bachao, Paisa Kamao':INC will launch a flagship electricity tariff scheme whereby a cash rebate will be provided to households conserving electricity. If any household has used less units of electricity in one month, in comparison to the average consumption of electricity for the same month in the preceding three years, then such household will be provided a cash back on their electricity bill. It will be at the rate of 3 per unit up to a maximum of ₹500 per consumer.

### 13.1.5
The Delhi government in the last 5 years has given approximately ₹9,000 crores to the private companies. Despite INC's repeated questioning to the Delhi government, the details of consumers benefitting from these transactions have not been furnished. Instead of giving such huge amounts to the private companies, the INC will ensure that consumers are benefitted through Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, and provide free and discounted domestic electricity, as per the following rates. This can be done without adding any burden on the exchequer..

| Up to 300 units | Free |
|---|---|
| 300-400 units | 50% discount |
| 400-500 units | 30% discount |
| 500-600 units | 25% discount |

### 13.1.6
The high cost of electricity has forced industries out of Delhi in the past five years, leading to job losses for Delhi's residents. The number of factories in Delhi has fallen 12%, from 2013-14 to 2017-18 according to the Annual Survey of Industries carried out by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The number of workers employed has declined 9% from 75,273 in 2013-14 to 68,630 in 2017-18, making an already bad unemployment situation worse. Delhi's unemployment rate is double than the national avg. One of the main reasons for this is high rates of electricity for industrial and non-domestic sector, which is the highest in the country. Due to the high prices of Industrial / Commercial electricity, industries and commercial establishments are moving out of Delhi, thereby resulting in massive unemployment. INC will provide industrial power at a tariff rate of ₹ 6/ unit as done by INC Government in Punjab, and this will be inclusive of all municipal taxes and surcharges, to get non-polluting industries back in Delhi.

### 13.1.7
INC shall charge domestic power tariff rates to those professional activities (such as lawyers, chartered accountants, media professionals, architects etc..) as defined in Chapter 15 of the Delhi Master Plan in relation to "mixed-land use", that are permitted in residential areas.

### 13.1.8
INC will provide free electricity up to 200 units to all small shops/commercial establishments having connected load of less than 5 kW.

### 13.1.9
INC will provide for the installation of a separate metre to encourage and incentivize usage of electric vehicles. The charges for such usage will be 50% of the domestic rates per unit.

### 14.1.6

## 14.2 Social Security for the Vulnerable

### 14.2.1
Safai Karamcharis face acute professional hazards by being exposed to dust, garbage and hazardous waste. INC will ensure they are provided with adequate safety gear, including proper gloves, masks etc. Agencies and concerned officers will be held liable for punishment who engage in or perpetuate manual cleaning of sewers.

### 14.2.2
For the last 5 years, Delhi has seen Safai Karamcharis going on strike and protests on roads for the non-payment of salaries, arrears and retirement benefits for months. These protests adversely affected the cleanliness of the city and increased health hazards. The MCD and Delhi Government only engaged in blame games and did nothing important for this segment, who should be called Paryavaran Rakshaks. We should give them due respect and ensure they are properly taken care of by the government. INC will name Safai Karamcharis as Paryavaran Rakshaks. We will implement the 5th Delhi Finance Commission Report without withholding the amount due to the municipal corporations. During the INC regime, whenever municipal corporations faced constraints in paying salaries to their employees, the Delhi INC always came to the rescue of the municipal corporations, and we will continue to support them

### 14.2.3
All temporary, ad-hoc, and contractual Safai Karamcharis will be regularised.

### 14.2.4
INC will ensure basic facilities for SafaiKaramcharis, like shed, drinking water etc.

### 14.2.6
INC will initiate a scheme in which any needy person, without means for conducting the last rites of any family member, can approach an elected representative, and on his/her recommendation and a proforma, the cremation ground will provide free facility which shall be reimbursed by the government.

### 14.2.7
With the advent of taxi services like Ola, Uber etc., legally plying three-wheelers and e-rickshaw owners are facing difficulty repaying loans. Looking at this difficulty, the INC, as a one-time gesture, will grant subsidy to their owners, so that they can pay installments of pending loans.

## 14.3
The INC-led UPA government had enacted Street Vendors Protection of Livelihood Act in 2013. Under this Act, vending spaces, number equaling 2.5% of the population, were to be identified, created and distributed among the street vendors. Unfortunately, out of 5 lakh vending spaces to be created, not even one has been created or allotted in the last 5 years. Under Sec. 3 of this Act, until these 5 lakh spaces were identified and allotted, no street vendor could have been uprooted from his/her vending space. Unfortunately, in the last 5 years, thousands of vendors have been uprooted from their vending spaces. The state government has failed to protect their right to livelihood under the Act. Even though elections for Town Vending Committees, as provided under this Act, have taken place, these Committees are non-functional because of official apathy. The INC will ensure that 5 lakh vending spaces as provided under the Act shall be identified, created and allotted to the street vendors at the earliest, and no street vendor shall be uprooted before this exercise is conducted, as per the provisions of the Act.

### 14.3.1

These will also include 'Labour Registration Centres' for providing labourers assistance in social security schemes. Provision for new and existing labour addas should be made in the upcoming master plan. These spaces will also act as linkages with skill development centres.

# 15. INDUSTRY, TRADE & COMMERCE
AAP Government ruined Delhi's Economy by no real growth, no jobs and spending on freebies and advertisements. Both BJP & AAP have failed to create jobs. Government of India itself has conceded that the National unemployment is at a 45-year high. CMIE Data shows that the National Average Rate of Unemployment in last 4 months is 7.53% and for Delhi, it is double the National average at 15.03%. The number of factories in Delhi has fallen 12.40%, from 2013-14 to 2017-18 according to the Annual Survey of Industries carried out by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The number of workers employed has declined 9% from 75,273 in 2013-14 to 68,630 in 2017-18, making an already bad unemployment situation worse. No amount of spins could change that AAP Government completely demolished the fiscal responsibility of the Government of NCT, Delhi. They did not encourage investment; industrial projects started during INC's regime are still pending. An abysmal number of jobs have been added. That is the reason none of their glitzy advertisements focus on youth or job creation. INC will place Delhi's economy back on track, and if Delhi is on track, then India will be on the path of real growth.




## 15.1

INC will ensure permission to change of trade and industry in case it is a non-polluting industry and easy conversion into free hold land as provide in other industrial areas.
