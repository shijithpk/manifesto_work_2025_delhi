## Foreword
Under the visionary and decisive leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra
Modi, the country has achieved many milestones since we received your unequivocal
mandate in 2014 and then again in 2019. In these six years, the BJP government at the
Centre has placed the country's growth on the fast track, improved the standard of
living for lakhs of families and created the foundation for a more prosperous future for
each and every citizen of the country. The scale, speed and scope of the transformation
which we have brought to the country is unprecedented. We have set a new benchmark
of clean, transparent, participative and efficient governance which has enabled this
positive change for the country and its people. We have made every possible effort to
fulfill our core principle of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”. Prime Minister
Modi's vision for a ‘New India' is being achieved progressively with our every action and
initiative. We are committed to continue on this path with single-minded focus and
determined effort.

During the last six years, we have tried to ensure that Delhi is on pace with the country
and it's unique place as the capital of an emerging global power is strengthened. We
have worked in a dedicated manner to improve the living experience for the people of
Delhi in a holistic and comprehensive manner. We have taken steps to ensure that ‘ease
of living' is central to our planning and execution for Delhi. In the last six years, we have
efficiently completed major infrastructure projects which not only solve present issues
like congestion but also anticipate the needs of the future. We have worked to enable
the provision of high quality basic amenities so that the people of Delhi are able to
pursue newer opportunities and bigger aspirations. In consideration of the important
issues faced by the people of Delhi, we have taken historic decisions such as the
regularisation of unauthorised colonies. We have focussed on making Delhi safer,
better and more prosperous. We have ensured inclusive progress through considered
commitment. Through our wide-ranging initiatives, we have cherished the heritage of
the city and prepared it for the future. We are proud of the fact that we have achieved so
much for Delhi and all sections of its citizens.

01


The people of Delhi know that we have managed to ensure the gains of the past years in
spite of the confrontational attitude of the AAP government in the state. The AAP
government tried to obstruct all our initiatives for narrow political gains and deprived
the people of Delhi of even greater benefits. Key initiatives of the Central government
like Ayushman Bharat, which have immensely benefited people of other states, have
been denied to the people of Delhi due to the petty blocking tactics of the AAP
government. Nevertheless, we have determinedly worked for the people of Delhi and
ensured that their dreams of a better tomorrow are fulfilled.






Our concrete work bears testimony to our sincerity and commitment to the progress of
Delhi and its people. The stark contrast of our good intentions and the political
opportunism of the AAP government is clear to the people of Delhi. The complete faith
reposed by you in the BJP during the Lok Sabha is a clear reflection of the will of the
people. The only alternative for the rapid development of Delhi is the “double engine" of
the BJP government in the Centre and well as the state. The immense possibilities which
the BJP can ensure for Delhi will fast-forward Delhi into a new era of prosperity and
opportunity. We are confident that the people of Delhi have made up their mind to
entrust us with the governance of the state so that their aspirations and vision for Delhi
are realized in a speedy manner.

We are prepared to fulfill this sacred trust with all intent, efforts and resources and it is
with this objective that we launched the “Meri Delhi, Mera Sujhaav" campaign to collate
the people's vision for Delhi. Through this 15 day outreach, we engaged with lakhs of
citizens in Delhi and collected more than 11 lakh suggestions from the people through
various means. The suggestions, which paint the people's dreams for this city, form the
core part of our Vision which we present before you today.

Our vision is inspired by the ideas, aspirations and ambitions which the people cherish
for Delhi. It is the path of progress which the people of Delhi want to embark on with us. It
is the description of a more glorious tomorrow which the people envisage. It is a plan for
Delhi formulated by its most important stakeholders- its people. We stand by the people
of Delhi in their quest for a better life and this Sankalp Patra articulates our roadmap to
realize this vision in a prompt and efficient manner.

Today, through this Sankalp Patra, we present before you our intention to make Delhi a
world-class National Capital which is representative of the strength, aspirations and
opportunities of New India. In the next five years, we are committed to transforming
Delhi at an unprecedented pace into a modern, prosperous, and vibrant city, which will
serve as a national and international benchmark.

02

We will ensure maximum opportunities of development and highest ‘ease of living' for
the residents of Delhi. We will create a Delhi with all the promise of the future while
retaining all the glory of its past. We are committed to ensure that all the citizens of Delhi,
irrespective of class, caste, religion and gender, have the opportunity to make a better
life for themselves. Above all else, we believe that our paramount duty is to enable the
women, the youth, the traders, the labourers, the slum-dweller and all others living in
Delhi experience a supportive and encouraging environment as they pursue their
hopes and dreams.

In the next five years, our every waking moment will be spent in fulfilling the promises of
this Sankalp Patra. We are committed to use our experience, determination and
dedication to ensure that the vision conveyed to us by the people of Delhi is converted
into reality. We are confident that the people of Delhi will support us in this endeavour
and give us a clear mandate to deliver on these commitments. With great hope and
belief, we present to you our vision for a world-class and modern Delhi that we can all be
proud of.

Modi's mission of “Housing for all by 2022”,
we are committed to provide pucca
houses to all residents of Delhi by 2022.

income groups. Loans at subsidized rates

DDA flats as well.

allotted in a speedy manner. Over 52,000
houses built in the industrial areas for
labourers and people belonging to the
lower income group will also be allotted on
a priority basis.
08 We will empower and strengthen the Delhi
Urban Shelter Improvement Board to help
accelerate the creation of new housing in
Delhi.
05

## Modern Amenities and Ownership Rights
01 Building on the historic decision of the BJP
government under the leadership of Shri
Narendra Modi to regularise unauthorised
colonies, a special 'Colonies Development
Board' will be established to equip these
colonies with civic amenities such as
schools, community centres, hospitals,
roads, gutters, and sewers on a priority
basis.
02 We will ensure ownership rights for
residents of all Resettlement Colonies by
converting their properties into freehold

regularised after payment of nominal

allotment societies will be resolved on
priority.

interests of the Pagdi tenants in the city

the residents of Delhi through focussed
and priority creation of key infrastructure
such as roads, flyovers, foot over bridges
(FOBs) etc.

been neglected and remain
underdeveloped. A special scheme will be
formulated for the rapid development of
these aspirational areas.
03 Road junctions with high-volume will be
equipped with flyover bridges to ensure
decongestion. For pedestrian
convenience, FOBs will be constructed at
such junctions.

constructed on busy railway crossings to
prevent traffic jams.
05 Scenic, green pedestrian walkways will be
built all over Delhi. Footpaths will be
upgraded and constructed across the city

electricity to meet the power
requirements at the roundabout and
