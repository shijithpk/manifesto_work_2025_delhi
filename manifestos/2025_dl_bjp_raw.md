## Letter from the State President

Dear Residents,

Greetings!

The Bharatiya Janata Party proudly presents the ‘Viksit Delhi Sankalp
Patra 2025'—a roadmap for a brighter future for Delhi. This is not just an
election manifesto but a testament to our firm commitment to bring
positive changes to every citizen's life. It reflects the promises BJP
makes to the residents of Delhi-promises that AAP-DA has failed to
fulfill in the last ten years.

AAP-DA's tenure has been marred by corruption, scandals and
administrative failures. Issues like the liquor scam, misuse of public
funds for personal gains, irregularities in construction projects, and
increasing pollution have made life challenging for Delhi's residents.
Instead of solving problems, AAP-DA's mismanagement has only
added to people's insecurity and inconvenience. Their promises on
education, healthcare, water supply and pollution control remain
unfulfilled.

When BJP forms the government, we will give Delhi a new direction.
We will implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme, ensuring affordable
and quality healthcare for every citizen. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission,
we will provide clean water to every household. Additionally, we will
provide housing to 3.5 lakh poor families, ensuring everyone has a safe
home. Special financial assistance schemes for women will also be
introduced to help them achieve economic independence.

The BJP will act as a new hope for Delhi, striving to make it free from
pollution, corruption and insecurity, and transforming it into a
prosperous and safe state. Basic facilities such as electricity, water,
healthcare, education and cleanliness will be delivered responsibly,
supported by the benefits of central government schemes.

Let us come together to make Delhi a proud and developed state once
again.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,

Virendra Sachdeva
President, Bharatiya Janata Party, Delhi




## Letter from the Sankalp Patra Samiti Chairman

Greetings,

Sapne Sarkar Karegi Sakar, Dilli me Bhajpa Sarkar!!

From the days of Indraprastha during the Mahabharata era till today,
Delhi has witnessed a remarkable journey of growth and development.
Unfortunately, due to the failures of AAP-DA, our capital now struggles
with various challenges. Today, Delhi is counted among the most
polluted cities in the world. The air has become so toxic that it is difficult
to breathe. The Yamuna river has turned into a polluted drain, filled with
filth and garbage.

The Delhi Assembly Elections of 2025 bring an opportunity to restore
the city's dignity and pride. The time for change has arrived. It is time to
put an end to the hardships of the capital and fulfill the dreams of
prosperity for Delhi's residents. The BJP presents its vision through the
'Viksit Delhi Sankalp Patra 2025' to shape a better future for all.

Let us unite under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister, Shri
Narendra Modi, and choose a double-engine BJP government for Delhi.
Together, we can build a cleaner, pollution-free, developed and world-
class Delhi for ourselves and future generations.

Thank you.

Jai Hind!

Yours sincerely,

Ramvir Singh Bidhuri
Chairperson, Election Manifesto Committee,
Bharatiya Janata Party, Delhi

Reality of a Polluted Delhi**

* Due to AAP-DA's negligence, Delhi's AQI

When the BJP

schemes continue,
but they will also be
made more
effective and
corruption in these
schemes will be
weeded out.
_Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi_


We pledge to create a developed Delhi
that will make the entire nation proud.
Delhi will not only symbolise India's
glorious history and rich cultural
heritage but also serve as a model of
world-class infrastructure, effective
law and justice systems, a clean
environment and excellent urban
services. Through collaboration
between the central and state
governments, Delhi will lead India's
growth story, embodying a remarkable
blend of tradition and modernity.


## Good Governance
In the past 10 years, AAP-DA has pushed Delhi into chaos and corruption.
Their ministers ended up in jail and their leaders misused public funds to
fuel their luxurious lives and to fight elections. We will implement a zero-
tolerance policy on corruption to make Delhi corruption free.


**Zero Tolerance
against Corruption**

* We will adopt a 'zero tolerance'
policy against the widespread
misgovernance and corruption of
AAP-DA, and we will constitute an
Special Investigation Team (SIT) to

Policy, Jal Board, etc.

which was withheld by AAP-DA, in
the first session of the Legislative
Assembly.

future and ensure that such mistakes
are never repeated.
* We will cooperate with the CBI and
ED for a time-bound investigation of
the AAP-DA's liquor policy, ensuring
that the guilty leaders are punished
and the revenue loss from this scam
is fully recovered. Additionally, we will
end the current liquor licensing
policy and implement a new,
transparent and accountable
policy.

chairmanship of a retired judge of
the Delhi High Court to conduct a
time-bound investigation of the
Sheeshmahal scam.

chairmanship of a retired judge of
the Delhi High Court to conduct a
time-bound investigation of the
scams related to construction of
classrooms and school buildings
and the appointment of ghost
teachers in Delhi government
schools.
* We will set up an SIT under the
chairmanship of a retired judge of
the Delhi High Court to conduct a
time-bound investigation of the
Mohalla Clinic scam, focusing on:
    * Deplorable condition of Mohalla
    clinics, despite spending crores of
    rupees annually
    * 65,000 fake lab tests conducted
    in Mohalla Clinics

appointments made on the basis of
nepotism by AAP-DA, based on the
findings of the Shunglu Committee
report.

investigation and recovery of the
₹26,000 crore owed by DISCOMs to
the Delhi government.

**Good Governance**
Our government will not make any
excuses or blame others for the
problems related to pollution, traffic,
electricity, water, transport, etc. of
Delhi and will find effective
solutions by collaborating with the
neighbouring states, MCD, NDMC
and the central government.
* We will increase the scope of the CM
helpline and regularly organise
good governance drives and
camps. In addition, we will also
organise CM camps in every ward
for effective grievance redressal of

    backward classes

## Garib Kalyan

The central government's welfare schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana
and Jal Jeevan Mission have helped millions of poor families and improved
their lives. However, AAP-DA has failed to implement these schemes due to
their petty politics. We will ensure the effective implementation of these
key schemes in Delhi with the support of the central government, putting
the needs of the disadvantaged first.

* In our first cabinet meeting, we will
implement the central government's
Ayushman Bharat Yojana, to provide
free treatment up to ₹5 lakh and the
state government will provide ₹5
lakh additional cover for all the poor
families.

diagnostic services to all poor
families.

Distribution System (PDS) by setting

Weaker Section (EWS) Commission
to address issues related to the EWS
community.
* We will ensure an adequate number
of shelter homes in Delhi and equip
them with all requisite facilities.


## Ensuring Basic Amenities in JJ Clusters

AAP-DA has repeatedly ignored the welfare of JJ clusters' residents in Delhi,
leaving them without basic facilities. BJP will bring meaningful change in
their lives by prioritising their welfare and development through schemes
like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, PM SHRI and Pink Police Booths. We will
provide affordable housing, quality education, world-class connectivity and
better security for JJ cluster residents.

**Infrastructure Development**

* We will establish Atal Canteens in JJ
clusters to provide nutritious meals
at ₹5.
* We have provided houses to JJ
cluster residents in areas like Kalkaji
and Ashok Vihar under the Pradhan
Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).
Similarly, we will provide an
additional 3.5 lakh pucca houses for
JJ cluster residents and
underprivileged communities, in
collaboration with the central
government.

clean drinking water in JJ clusters.

water to JJ clusters' residents.

Mandirs near JJ clusters to provide

resident of JJ clusters.

(MCD) to form the Delhi JJ Cluster
Sanitation Task Force, which will:

    trash bins and implement
    separate collection for dry and
    wet waste
    * Build additional community
    toilets and ensure the
    maintenance of existing toilets
    to improve sanitation

on the lines of PM SHRI, to open new
schools with modern classrooms
and qualified teachers in JJ clusters
and upgrade existing government
schools.

camps in all Delhi JJ clusters within
three months, in collaboration with
the central government, to ensure
enrolment in welfare schemes like
Ayushman Bharat, PM Jeevan Jyoti
Bima Yojana and PM Suraksha
Bima Yojana.
* We will establish Sushma Swaraj
Sadan Libraries in JJ clusters.
* We will start shuttle services,
including e-rickshaws and e-bikes, to
connect JJ cluster residents with
metro stations, bus stops, etc. We
will provide access to these services
to women on priority.

**Safety and Security**

* We will set up police chowkis in JJ
clusters to ensure security.
* We will set up a network of CCTV
cameras in JJ clusters to improve
security and prevent crimes.
* We will launch special training
programs for the police force to
increase sensitivity towards JJ
clusters' residents.
* We will establish cluster security
committees with local police and
residents to make JJ clusters a
'crime-free zone'.


## Regularisation of Unauthorised Colonies

AAP-DA has failed to regularise unauthorised colonies and ignored their
basic needs like 24x7 electricity, cleanliness, and regular water supply. BJP
is committed to improve the lives of people living in unauthorised colonies.

* We will grant full ownership rights
to 1700 unauthorised colonies in
Delhi. Residents of these colonies will
receive complete ownership rights
to their homes and will be able to
construct, build or rebuild their
homes as per the provisions of the
Ministry of Housing and Delhi's
building bylaws.
* We will create a special task force
with the support of the central
government to regularise all eligible
unauthorised colonies on
government land and provide
ownership rights.
* We will set up a Colony Upgradation
Commission to ensure community
centres, roads, drainage systems,
waste collection and sewage
facilities in these colonies.
* We will establish Ayushman Bharat
Arogya Mandirs near unauthorised
colonies to ensure basic primary
healthcare and welfare for every
resident.
* We will implement the Jal Jeevan
Mission and ensure ‘har ghar nal se
jal' in every home in unauthorised
colonies and take strict action
against tanker mafias.


## Women Empowerment

AAP-DA has failed at women empowerment despite its promises. We are
dedicated to turning the vision of women-led development into a reality.
We have already demonstrated our commitment to the socio-economic
empowerment of women in other BJP-ruled states and we are determined
to empower women in Delhi as well.


**Financial Empowerment**

* We will provide financial assistance
of ₹2,500 monthly to women from
poor families under Mahila
Samriddhi Yojana.
* We will provide 33% reservation to
women in Delhi Government jobs.
* We will partner with e-commerce
and quick-commerce platforms to

students from Delhi Government
schools after passing class 12th.

1,000 women drivers for purchasing
pink e-autos.


**Social Empowerment**

* We will provide LPG cylinders for
₹500 to women from poor families,
and one free cylinder each on the
occasion of Holi and Deepawali.
* We will launch the Mukhya Mantri
Kanyadaan Yojana, offering
financial assistance of ₹50,000 for
the marriage of daughters from
poor families.
* We will increase the monthly
pension for widows, destitute and
abandoned women from ₹2,500 to
₹3,000.

every pregnant woman under Chief
Minister Matritva Suraksha Yojana.

and ovarian cancer screenings for
women at all government hospitals
covered under the Ayushman Bharat
scheme.

toilets equipped with facilities like
sanitary napkin vending machines
and feeding rooms for infants.

honorarium to ₹12,000 for
Anganwadi workers, ₹7,000 for
Anganwadi assistants and ₹6,000
for ASHA workers, while also
providing them with health and life
insurance coverage.


**Ensuring Safety and Security**

* We will collaborate with the central
government to deploy Anti-Romeo
Squads at all public spaces.
* We will set up a network of CCTV
cameras across Delhi to ensure
safety and security.
* We will establish the Jhalkari Bai
Battalion, Delhi's first women's
police battalion, in collaboration
with the central government.


## Welfare of Senior Citizens

Due to the non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat and poor
maintenance of Mohalla Clinics, senior citizens are plagued by inadequate
healthcare and other issues. Our government is committed to providing
equal treatment and proper care for Delhi's senior citizens. We will expand
healthcare services, provide better social security benefits and promote
welfare programs.

* We will increase the senior citizens
pension for citizens aged 60-70 from
₹2,000 to ₹2,500 and for senior
citizens, widows, divyang and
destitutes aged 70+ from ₹2,500 to
₹3,000.

₹5 lakh under Ayushman Bharat
Yojana and the state government will

along with free OPD and diagnostic
services to all the 70+ senior citizens.

ambulances to provide 24x7
emergency services to senior
citizens.

check-ups and medicines at all
government hospitals.

complexes in every district with
medical, yoga, physiotherapy and
recreation facilities and financial
and digital counselling services.

workshops to familiarise senior
citizens with smartphones, online
banking and government services
and to protect them from cyber
fraud.
* We will encourage senior citizens to
register on the Senior Able Citizens
Reemployment in Dignity
(SACRED) portal for quality skill
development and employment
opportunities.


## Arogya Delhi

In spite of spending crores of rupees on Mohalla clinics, they still remain
dysfunctional and continue to struggle with lack of resources. We are
committed to the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana in Delhi
and upgradation of the overall healthcare infrastructure, prioritising
preventive healthcare.

* In our first cabinet meeting, we will
implement the central government's
Ayushman Bharat Yojana, to provide
free treatment up to ₹5 lakh and the
state government will provide ₹5
lakh additional cover for all the poor
families.
* We will transform dysfunctional and
dilapidated Mohalla clinics into
Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, and
provide the following facilities:
    * Medical care during pregnancy
    and for newborns
    * OPD services
    * Diagnosis and treatment of both
    communicable and non-
    communicable diseases
* We will improve the infrastructure
facilities across all government
hospitals in Delhi through the
Ayushman Bharat Health
Infrastructure Mission (ABHIM).

hospital in every district.

colleges and new nursing,
pharmacy and paramedical
colleges in Delhi.

recruitment to fill vacant positions
for doctors, nurses, lab technicians
and paramedical staff.
* We will introduce a new law for the
protection of doctors and ensure its
strict enforcement.
* We will set up 500 new Jan
Aushadhi Kendras to provide
citizens with quality medicines at
affordable prices.
* We will provide free dialysis
services across all government
hospitals under the Pradhan Mantri
National Dialysis Programme.
* We will set up a special task force to
make Delhi dengue-free and work
towards this goal in a time-bound
manner.


## World-class Education

Despite AAP-DA's claims of improvement in education, government schools
in Delhi continue to suffer from overcrowding and insufficient resources. We
are fully committed to transforming Delhi's education system by investing in
improved infrastructure, student welfare and teacher training. Our focus will
be on skill-based learning, integrating advanced technology in classrooms
and ensuring quality education for every child.


**Quality School Education**

* We will provide free KG to PG
education to poor students taking
admission in Delhi's government
institutions.
* We will introduce CM SHRI, along the
lines of PM SHRI, to provide English
medium education and world-class
infrastructure in 100 government
schools.

## Sabka Saath Saath Vikas

AAP-DA has ignored the needs of the underprivileged communities of Delhi
and completely ignored its responsibility towards their welfare. As a result,
many people have been deprived of essential resources. The
confrontational approach of AAP-DA has hindered the development of
Delhi and ignored the aspirations of countless families. On the contrary, BJP
believes in the principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. We will provide every

## Robust Economy

Delhi has failed to realise its full economic potential due to the
financial mismanagement and corruption by AAP-DA. In order to
harness its true potential, Delhi needs to create a world-class
ecosystem that will develop a knowledge-based economy. We are
committed to transforming Delhi into an economic powerhouse by
leveraging its core strengths, providing job opportunities for the
youth.

* We will make Delhi a developed
economy and play a crucial role in
making India a global economic
power.
* We will attract at least $50 billion in
FDI in the next five years and make
Delhi one of the top FDI destinations
in India.
* We will develop a Special Zone for
Advanced Research & Knowledge
(SPARK) Delhi with an investment
of ₹10,000 crore, a world-class hub
for finance, banking, investment, IT,
GCC and research and development,
creating over 10 lakh direct and
indirect jobs in the next 10 years.

    aim of attracting FDI and

    centre for MICE tourism

and make Delhi one of the top 3
states in India in ease of doing
business.

industrial areas and provide them
with civic amenities such as water,
electricity and roads.
* We will review the Delhi Industrial
Development, Operation and
Maintenance Act.
* We will eliminate the corruption
that has taken place in cooperative
societies during AAP-DA's rule and
will formulate a new Delhi
cooperative policy.


## Trader Welfare

AAP-DA has burdened Delhi's traders with complex regulations,
inadequate infrastructure and a lack of support for businesses. Due to
mismanagement under their governance, many traders have been
forced to relocate to other states. The BJP is committed to simplifying
regulations, improving infrastructure and fostering a business-
friendly environment in Delhi for traders and entrepreneurs.

* We will establish a judicial authority
that will complete the process of
opening sealed shops within 6
months. This will provide relief to
traders and boost the city's
economic activities.
* We will convert all leasehold
properties of L&DO (Land and
Development Office) to freehold.

Trader Welfare Board to address the
demands of traders and resolve their

Upgradation Mission' to upgrade all
major markets with improved urban
planning, modern infrastructure,

documentation and meet audit
requirements.

insurance scheme for all domestic
traders registered under GST in
Delhi.

monthly pension to all eligible small
traders and entrepreneurs under
the Pradhan Mantri Laghu Vyapari
Mandhan Yojana.


## Ease of Living for All

Over the last decade, the central government has prioritised delivering
essential services through initiatives like PM Awas Yojana, Jal Jeevan
Mission and Saubhagya Yojana-services that the AAP government has
failed to provide to the people of Delhi. Our commitment is to develop
robust infrastructure that ensures clean drinking water, uninterrupted
power supply, affordable housing and effective flood management for
everyone.


**Clean Water**

* We are committed to provide ‘har
ghar nal se jal' under the Jal Jeevan
Mission.
* We are committed to address the
issue of contaminated water and
ensure the supply of clean water
through taps.
* We will increase Delhi's water
treatment capacity to 1,500 MGD
and establish additional reservoirs to
enhance water storage and pumping
capacity.

revenue water from 58% to 20% and
reduce water loss in the Munak Canal

treaties in 2025, in collaboration with
Haryana, ensuring a fair share of
Yamuna water to meet Delhi's
growing water needs.

Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to
bring additional water from Ganga
to meet Delhi's increasing water
demand.

rainwater harvesting and

groundwater sources. Additionally,

capacity in Delhi's natural water
bodies, such as lakes in the Asola
Bhatti area, Najafgarh Lake, Central
Ridge ponds and others.

development charges imposed by
the Delhi Jal Board on water
connections.

poor households under PM Surya
Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana.

in all Delhi government and Delhi
Municipal Corporation buildings by
2027 to promote the use of
renewable energy.
* We will eliminate corruption in the
process of obtaining electricity
connections and ensure a
streamlined faceless system for a
hassle-free experience.


**Housing**

* We will collaborate with the central
government under the Pradhan
Mantri Awas Yojana to provide an
additional 3.5 lakh pucca houses to
poor families over the next 5 years.

government to provide piped gas
connections to every household.

Plan 2041 in collaboration with the
central government, aimed at

address the growing demand for
housing and remove FSI restrictions
wherever possible to facilitate the
construction of high-rise buildings.
* We will collaborate with the central
government to amend RERA to
make home ownership a reality for
middle-class families. This will
include measures such as reducing
registration costs, lowering
construction expenses and
streamlining the approval process
for building plans.


**Flood-free Delhi**

* We will make Delhi 'flood-free' with
an investment of ₹700 crore.
* We will implement a flood
forecasting system using real-time
data to predict urban flooding,
enabling timely action and ensuring
the safety of citizens.


**Sewage Treatment**

* We will ensure that every household
has access to sewerage facilities by
increasing the capacity of sewage
treatment plants to 1,000 MGD and
common effluent treatment plants
to 220 MLD to ensure 100%
treatment of sewage and effluent.
* We will ensure that all sewage
treatment plants discharging
treated water into the Yamuna
comply with the Delhi Pollution
Control Committee (DPCC)
standards. Currently, 21 out of 37
plants in Delhi do not meet these
standards.
* We will review and reduce the
development charges imposed by
the Delhi Jal Board for sewerage
connections.


## Development of Rural Delhi

We are dedicated to ensuring the welfare of farmers. Our government has
introduced a range of initiatives aimed at supporting agriculture, providing
credit facilities and enhancing infrastructure. We will make it a priority to
focus on the development of villages in Delhi, ensuring they thrive and
prosper.


**Prosperous Farmers**

of all eligible farmers in Delhi under

    operation and maintenance of cow

transport them from the roads to
sheds and animal shelters.

animals under the Nakul Swasthya
Patra Yojana, providing them with
health insurance and regular health
check-ups.


## World-class Connectivity

The BJP has prioritised enhancing connectivity across the country through
landmark initiatives such as PM Gati Shakti and Bharatmala. Meanwhile, Delhi's
infrastructure under AAP-DA has significantly deteriorated. DTC buses are
poorly maintained, traffic congestion has worsened and road quality continues
to decline. The BJP remains steadfast in its commitment to infrastructure
development and improving connectivity, as demonstrated by the progress in
states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Metro projects have been successfully
launched in cities such as Kanpur, Pune, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. However, due
to the inefficiencies of AAP-DA, the DMRC has been unable to complete Phase IV
of the Delhi Metro on schedule. Our vision is to reduce traffic congestion across
key areas in Delhi and deliver a world-class, affordable public transport network
for its citizens.


**Accessible Public Transportation**

* We will create a clean, affordable
and accessible public transport
network that reduces dependence
on private vehicles through last-
mile connectivity. This will help
address and reduce issues related to
traffic and parking.
* We will establish an integrated
public transport network with an
investment of ₹20,000 crore and
ensure Delhi becomes one of the
top-10 cities on the Urban Mobility
Index.
* We will establish a Unified
Metropolitan Transit Authority to
coordinate the plans of DTC, DMRC,
NCRTC and Indian Railways, ensuring
integrated transport planning for
Delhi, in collaboration with the
central government.
* We will work towards modernising
Delhi's public transportation
through light rail, pod taxis, etc.


**Road Transport**

* We will transform Delhi into a 100%
e-bus city by increasing the
number of e-buses to 13,000 to
improve connectivity.
* We will revise and integrate bus
routes with existing and under-
construction metro lines and RRTS
corridors.
* We will operate a two-tier bus
system that will include midi and
mini buses, to ensure last-mile
connectivity.
* We will upgrade all bus depots and
terminals to maintain the expanded
bus fleet, along with constructing
new depots along the Urban
Extension Road-II to ensure smooth
bus operations throughout the city.
* We will launch world-class AC and
non-AC interstate bus services to
states like Haryana, Punjab, Uttar
Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and
Rajasthan for an easy commute for
migrants living in Delhi.
* We will ensure quick construction
and operation of Dwarka and Narela
ISBTs for interstate connectivity to
Punjab, Haryana and other northern
states.


**Rail, Metro and RRTS**

* We will expedite the completion of
Delhi Metro Phase IV, in
collaboration with the central
government, which has been
delayed due to AAP-DA.
* We will plan for Delhi Metro Phase V,
ensuring completion of detailed
project reports (DPRs) for all
proposed routes by 2026, in
collaboration with the central
government.
* We will provide overnight metro
services at appropriate
frequencies, working with DMRC,
ensuring 24x7 availability of metro
and bus services.
* The central government has
successfully completed the RRTS
corridor from New Ashok Nagar to
Meerut South. We will ensure RRTS
operations on the entire stretch
from Sarai Kale Khan to Modipuram
in 2025.
* We will enhance connectivity
between Jewar Airport and Delhi
through the metro and expressway
networks.
* We will launch the Delhi-Panipat
and Delhi-Alwar (RRTS) Namo Rail.


**Roads**

* We will improve Delhi's connectivity
with Gurugram and Noida in
collaboration with the central
government by launching extensive
development projects.
* We will start an Infrastructure
Overhaul Scheme that will focus on
roads, flyovers and FOBs to enhance
citizens' quality of life.
* Under AAP-DA, project delays have
led to traffic congestion. We will
ensure the timely completion of all
ongoing projects to alleviate traffic
issues.
* We will utilise the space under
flyovers to set up civic amenities
such as libraries, children's parks, etc.


**Traffic and Parking Management**

* We will launch a comprehensive
plan to eliminate traffic problems
and ensure adequate parking
facilities in all residential and
commercial areas of Delhi.
* We will construct additional flyovers,
tunnel roads and bypass roads to
address congestion at 117
congestion points across Delhi,
including Outer Ring Road, MG
Road, MB Road and Ashram Chowk.
* We will provide multi-storey and
underground parking facilities in
major markets like Sarojini Nagar,
Karol Bagh, Rajendra Nagar,
Malviya Nagar and other crowded
areas.


## Culture and Tourism

AAP-DA has failed to harness Delhi's tourism potential, with heritage sites
and monuments poorly maintained, tourism in decline and minimal
promotional efforts. We will revitalise Delhi's tourism by upgrading
infrastructure, preserving iconic sites and launching campaigns to attract
both domestic and international tourists.


**Promotion of Culture and Heritage**

* We will develop a grand
Mahabharata Corridor to promote
and showcase the famous epic of the
Mahabharata, in collaboration with

Pradesh and Haryana.

develop all forgotten and historically
significant sites in Delhi which do
not fall under the ASI.

Khurana Urban Heritage Mission'
with an allocation of ₹300 crore,
focusing on sites linked to specific
ethnic communities that hold

## Clean and Green Delhi

Under AAP-DA, Delhi has become one of the most polluted cities in the
world, and their claims of making Delhi pollution-free have proven hollow.
Beyond pollution, the government has also failed to clean the Yamuna river
despite making grand promises. The BJP is committed to creating a
pollution-free Delhi and cleaning up the Yamuna River. We will ensure that
Delhi becomes one of the cleanest and greenest cities, and that the Yamuna
regains its former glory.

* We will collaborate with the central
government to develop Yamuna
Riverfront, on the lines of the
Sabarmati Riverfront, ensuring 24x7
commercial establishments,
interactive shows, theatres and other
entertainment facilities along the
riverbanks.
* We will set up a Yamuna Kosh to
revitalise the Yamuna river, which
has been neglected by AAP-DA for
the past 10 years. Under this, we will:
    * Undertake full treatment of
    wastewater from drains like
    Barapullah, Shahdara and
    Ghazipur before it flows into the
    Yamuna
    * Treat water from all drains
    flowing into the Sahibi River,
    which has currently become a
    sewer
    * Expand sewage treatment plant
    capacity to 1,000 MGD and
    common effluent treatment
    plant capacity to 220 MLD
* Promote biodiversity along
Yamuna's banks by creating
green corridors, wetlands and
riverbank buffer zones
    * Ensure zero industrial emissions
    into the Yamuna
    * Organise an annual Yamuna
    Festival
* Our aim is to make Delhi the
cleanest metro city in the country
and secure the top rank in the
Swachh Survekshan rankings. To
achieve this, we will:
    * Increase treatment capacity to
    eliminate the garbage mountains
    at Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa,
    and redevelop them on the lines
    of Baansera Park
    * Prevent the formation of future
    garbage mountains by
    segregated collection and
    management of dry and wet
    waste
    * Work with the MCD to enhance
    waste collection capacity
    * Resolve sanitation-related
    complaints in real time through
    mobile app
    * Establish new waste-to-energy
    plants
* We will launch the Delhi Clean Air
Mission to halve Delhi's average AQI
by 2030 and reduce the number of
days with poor AQI. Our target is to
reduce PM-2.5 and PM-10 levels by
50%. Under this mission, we will:
    * Deploy road-sweeping machines
    in every assembly constituency
    and water-sprinkling machines
    in every municipal ward
    * Deploy additional road-
    sweeping machines and water-
    sprinkling machines in highly
    polluted areas like Anand Vihar,
    RK Puram and Mundka
    * Prioritise paving 500 kilometres
    of unpaved roads to control dust
    on streets
    * Install WAYU at intersections
    and key roads for maximum dust
    control
* We will incentivise the transition of
50% vehicles to electric/hybrid
vehicles and install public EV
charging points to make Delhi a
sustainable city.
* We will rejuvenate Delhi's ridges
and lakes, enhancing its
biodiversity.
* We will develop green belts, urban
forests and vertical gardens in
high-traffic areas to expand the
city's green cover.
* We will collaborate with all RWAs to
construct and maintain open gyms
and parks.
* We will construct new parks on the
lines of the Bharat Vandana Park in
Dwarka, in collaboration with the
central government.
